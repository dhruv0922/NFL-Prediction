## **Predicting NFL Game Outcomes Using Machine Learning**

This project uses basic NFL game statistics to predict whether a team will win or lose a game. It uses three simple machine learning models:
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression

All data comes from the NFLVerse play-by-play dataset: https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data

The project runs entirely in Google Colab.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab for step by step instructions on how to run the project.
